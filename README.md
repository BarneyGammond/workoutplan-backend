Back-end:
- Using Laravel, the back-end consists of an API with two databases, 'exercises' an exercise database and 'days' a days of the week database.
- There is a 'many to many' relationship between days of the week and these exercises.
- Each exercise carries a title and a short description.
- Each day consists of a number 1-7 and a series of exercises per day.

Stretch goals:

Adding a seeder to seed the database automatically.

Adding checkboxes to measure progress â€“ which potentially can be put into local storage (React) and a checkbox with a timer.

Adding a login and saving progress to local storage.

Add in a length of time and and an increased number of repetitions per set.

Add a datepicker to the front-end to allow users to select to and from dates for their workouts.
