Back-end:
- Using Laravel, the back-end consists of an API with two databases, an exercise database and a days of the week database.
- There is a 'one to many' relationship between days of the week and these exercises.
- Each exercise carries a title and a short description.
- Each day consists of a number 1-7 and a series of exercises per day.

Stretch goals:

Adding checkboxes to measure progress â€“ which potentially can be put into local storage (React) and a checkbox with a timer.

Adding a login and saving progress to local storage.

Add in a length of time and and an increased number of repetitions per set.
